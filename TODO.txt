  Make everything into bash_aliases.bash?
  Get special indentation stuff from linux
./linux:
    bashrc          (Mainly just default stuff)
    bashrc.local    (The real file, really outdated)

./mac:
    bash_profile    (All default, except I source my bashrc)
    bashrc          (The real file, since I created it)

./matt:
    bashrc          (Really just their junk)
    bashrc.local    (The real file)

./vb:
    bash_aliases    (Copied from matt...)
    bashrc          (Essentially the same as linux/bashrc)
